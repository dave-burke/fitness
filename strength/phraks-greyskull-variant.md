# Phraks Greyskull LP Variant

## Program

### Day 1

* 3x5 Overhead Press / Bench Press (alternating)
* 3x5 Chinups / Barbell Rows (alternating)
* 3x5 Squats

### Day 2

* 3x5 Overhead Press / Bench Press (alternating)

### Day 3

* 3x5 Overhead Press / Bench Press (alternating)

## Rules

* Last set is As Many Reps As Possible (AMRAP)
* Progress with 2.5lbs for upper body, 5lbs for lower body
* If final AMRAP set hits 10+ reps, double weight increase
* Any barbell row variant will do - I am partial to Yates Rows
* Feel free to use Power Cleans to warmup for Deadlifts
* Chinups are palms facing you, approximately shoulder width grip - begin unweighted, adding weight in 2.5lbs increments
* If you cannot do 3x5 chinups, do negatives until you can
* If you fail to make 5 reps in the FINAL SET, deload by 10%
