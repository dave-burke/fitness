# The Texas Method

## Monday: Volume Day

Use 90% of 5RM with *max* 8-10 minute rest time.

- Squat 5x5
- Bench or Press 5x5
- Deadlift 1x5

Limit (optional) assistance work to *brief* arm work on Monday.

## Wednesday: Recovery Day

- Squat 5x5 @ 80% of Monday's work weight
- Press or Bench (opposite of Monday) 3x5 @ 90% previous 5x5 weight
- Chin-up 3x bodyweight to failure (5 min rest time)
- Back Extension or Glute-Ham Raise 5x10

## Friday: Intensity Day

- Squat: warm-up, then work up to one single, new 5RM
- Bench or Press (same as Monday): work up to one single, new 5RM
- Power Clean 5x3 or Power Snatch 6x2

Optionally replace Olympic lifts with explosive deadlifts.

> Do most of your warm-up work light, first with the empty bar and then 135, and then take doubles or singles up to your one work set, the one that should give you a new 5RM.

> Make sure that the load is higher than Monday but not so much that form breaks down on the last reps. If it does, you picked the wrong weight.
