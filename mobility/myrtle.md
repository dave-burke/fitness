# Myrtle Hip Routine

1. Clamshells (8)
2. Lateral Leg Raises (10 each neutral, downward toe, upward toe)
3. Donkey Kicks (8)
4. Donkey Whips (5)
5. Fire Hydrant (8)
6. Knee Circle Forward (5 forward, 5 back)
7. Hurdle Trail Leg (5 forward, 5 back)
8. Lateral Leg Swing (10)
9. Leg Swing (10)
10. Leg Swing, Bent Knee (10)

This routine is more for mobility, not strength. I do less reps
and don't use a resistance band.
