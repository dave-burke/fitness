# My Workout Summaries

This is a place for me to keep track of the various strength work I do to
support my running passtime. These files serve as a quick reference and
an easy way to share workouts with friends.

When a workout came from the web, I include a link, but not the full article
or exercise descriptions.

Rep counts are how many I do and will be updated over time. They don't necessarily
reflect what's recommended in the source article.

All rep counts for single-leg exercises are "per leg" unless otherwise noted.
